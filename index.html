						 Ctrl O is pleased to announce that it has been named as an approved supplier for G-Cloud 6, the Government's online procurement framework. Its range of online software products is now in the catalogue, allowing Government departments to purchase the services with low administrative overheads when compared to other procurement methods. Products available include the Globally Accessible Data Store, an online tool that makes the access, storage and processing of tabular data extremely easy. Designed as a drop-in replacement for spreadsheets, it is ideal for organisations grappling with the management of datasets across disparate departments.

						 Ctrl O is pleased to announce that we have achieved certification to ISO27001:2005, the global Information Security Management System standard. Ctrl O’s management systems were thoroughly assessed and certified by BM Trada, a leading UKAS-accredited business assurance company. ISO27001 certification means that you can be confident that Ctrl O is managing your information securely, and has robust procedures in place to deal with any incidents. For Government departments, purchasing from an ISO27001-certified company (with the certificate issued by a UKAS-accredited body) is the first step to accrediting a product for the processing of official information.

					 <h3>Ctrl O stands for openness, our guiding principle.</h3>
           <p>We are open about the way we work, the applications we use and in all our dealings with customers.</p> 
           <p>The company was founded by a former member of the Armed Forces, who realised how much more productive teams and individuals could be if the services they used were built on ‘open’ technology. Systems could be compatible instead of clashing with each other. Changes and improvements would no longer rely on the say-so of a single dominant company. Business could be done with suppliers who earned the right, rather than the ones who had simply always been there.</p>
           <p>Openness breeds flexibility, so everyone benefits from this refreshing approach. No longer are you tied-in to one person or company’s way of doing things; instead, you can access systems and services that you need, just the way you want them. You can see all the components of the systems that are available, pick and choose the tools you want and mould them to your own requirements. Ctrl O provides services so good that we don’t need to tie you in.</p>

					 All Ctrl O products are web applications that are accessible from any standard computer with internet connectivity. All are fully managed services with round-the-clock support, meaning there is no need to worry about any of the maintenance or technical aspects of the service. For a free trial of any of the products, you are welcome to contact us and we’ll arrange a 30-day subscription.

                                    <h3>Globally Accessible Data Store (GADS) (<a href="/gads-brochure.pdf"><u>product leaflet</u></a>)</h3>
           <p>GADS provides a simple, user-friendly alternative to storing data in a spreadsheet or local database. It offers numerous benefits and special features:</p>
           <ul>
           	<li>– multiple users can view and update data simultaneously</li> 
            <li>– data views can be customised for individuals</li> 
            <li>– easy version control</li> 
            <li>– an approval process for updating data fields</li>
           </ul>
           <h3>Lenio facilities management software</h3>
           <p>Lenio is a simple, user-friendly facilities management package. Its primary function is the management of mandatory service items, using a simple calendar system that ensures that items are planned and completed by their due date, but it can also be used to track one-off items such as faults. This system is particularly well-suited to the education sector, where it has been proven to effectively and efficiently manage a school’s mandatory service items.</p>
           <h3>Group Email</h3>
           <p>Ctrl O Group Email Hosting offers an easy way to manage the distribution of emails to large and small groups of people. Each group has one email address – simply send a message to that single address and it will be distributed to everyone in the group. Enabling external parties to distribute emails to a group is as simple as providing the group’s collective email address. Maintaining distribution lists is made easier with a web control panel, or members can add and remove themselves to lists as desired.</p>
